# alaa-yahia-project1

Taps first frontend project. CSS, HTML, and simple JS.
Topics cards list, with header and footer. 

Notes:
1- We need a live server for the project to work.
2- There are many aspects that I haven't covered yet. 
I need to add the triangles to the header, make the website more responsive, and fix some line colors in CSS. 
I will be working on this during the coming week.
